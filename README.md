# 🤯 WhatTheCron

Ever stared at a cron expression like `*/15 9-17 * * MON-FRI` and whispered to yourself:

> “**What the CRON is this supposed to do?**”

Yeah, same.

## 🧠 Wait, what does this do?

Paste in a cron string, and you'll get:

- 🔍 A **human-readable explanation** (you won’t need a second monitor and Stack Overflow)
- 🕒 A list of **upcoming run times**
- 💡 A breakdown of **each field** with smart highlights
- 🎨 A slick UI that doesn't look like it's from 2006
- 🌘 Dark mode. Obviously.

## 🧪 Can I break it?

Yes. Go ahead. Type `* * * * walrus` and see what happens.

You’ll get **helpful error messages**, because even bad cron deserves love.

## 🧰 Tech Stuff (aka How the sausage is made)

- **Next.js** – Because pages are nice
- **TailwindCSS** – So I never touch a stylesheet again
